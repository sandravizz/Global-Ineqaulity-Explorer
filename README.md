# Global Inequality Explorer

## Project Vision

After completing the **Global Inequality Story** an animated, scroll-driven visual narrative built with Svelte, layercake and d3, it became clear that storytelling alone is not enough. While guided stories help introduce complex topics, users benefit from the ability to explore the data independently.

This project expands the original narrative into an **interactive data explorer** that allows users to:

- 🌍 Select regions and countries  
- 🔍 Explore data through self-directed analysis paths  
- 🧭 Follow insights based on personal curiosity and research goals  

The goal is to transform passive data storytelling into **active data exploration**, enabling deeper understanding and discovery of global inequality patterns.
